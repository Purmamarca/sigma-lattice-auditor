# Sigma Lattice Auditor 🛡️

A quantum-safe inspired Six Sigma quality audit engine for verifying statistical logic and process reliability.

## 📊 Overview

This project implements a robust quality auditing pipeline designed to verify statistical logic in high-stakes environments. It calculates key Six Sigma metrics and enforces quality gates as part of a continuous integration workflow.

## 🚀 Pipeline Features

- **Build Environment**: Automated setup of Python environments and dependencies.
- **Data Generation**: Synthetic measurement data generation for testing and validation.
- **Statistical Verification**: Calculation of Cp, Cpk, and Sigma Levels against specification limits.
- **Security & Linting**: Core security scans and code quality checks.

## 🛠️ Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+

### Running the Audit

1. Initialize the environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install .
   ```

2. Run the audit:
   ```bash
   python tests/test_data_generator.py
   python gatekeeper.py
   ```
